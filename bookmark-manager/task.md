# Build a Bookmark Manager App

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

For this lab, all the HTML and CSS has been provided to you. You will use JavaScript to complete the Bookmark Manager app so that it can store a collection of bookmarks in the local storage and read data from it.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have a `getBookmarks` function that returns the `bookmarks` array stored in the local storage. If the `bookmarks` key has not been set yet, or it doesn't contain a valid array with bookmarks, the `getBookmarks` function should return an empty array.
2. The `bookmarks` key stored in the local storage should be an array of bookmark objects. Each bookmark object should have three keys: `name`, `category`, and `url`.
3. You should have a function named `displayOrCloseForm` that toggles the `hidden` class on `#main-section` and `#form-section`.
4. When you click `#add-bookmark-button`, you should update the inner text of `.category-name` to be the value of the selected option from `#category-dropdown` and call `displayOrCloseForm` to display the form section and hide the main section.
5. When you click `#close-form-button`, you should run your function to hide the form section and display the main section.
6. When you click `#add-bookmark-button-form`, you should update the `bookmarks` key stored in the local storage by adding a bookmark object to the end of the array. The object should have `name` set to the value of the `#name` input, `category` set to the value of the selected option from the category dropdown, and `url` set to the value of the `#url` input.
7. Once the `bookmarks` key is updated, you should reset the value of `#name` and `#url` to an empty string before running your function to hide the form section and show the main section.
8. You should have a function named `displayOrHideCategory` that toggles the `hidden` class on `#main-section` and `#bookmark-list-section`.
9. When you click `#view-category-button`, you should update the inner text of `.category-name` to be the value of the selected option from `#category-dropdown`, modify the inner HTML of `#category-list` according to the user stories below, and call the `displayOrHideCategory` function.
10. If none of the bookmarks in local storage have the category, you should set the inner HTML of the `#category-list` to a `p` element with the text `No Bookmarks Found`.
11. If one or more bookmarks in local storage have the selected category, add a radio button for each bookmark to the innerHTML of the `#category-list`. Give each radio button an `id` and `value` set to the bookmark name, and a `name` that's the same for all the buttons.
12. Each radio button should have a corresponding label containing an anchor element with the bookmark name and the `href` attribute set to the bookmark URL.
13. When you click the `#close-list-button`, you should run your function to hide the `#bookmark-list-section` and display the main section.
14. When you click the `#delete-bookmark-button`, you should delete the bookmark corresponding to the selected radio button and appropriate category from the local storage and update the displayed bookmark list.

## Tests

 1. You should have a `getBookmarks` function.

 2. Your `getBookmarks` function should return an array.

 3. Your `getBookmarks` function should return the `bookmarks` key from `localStorage`.

 4. When the `bookmarks` key is not set in `localStorage` or is an empty array, the `getBookmarks` function should return an empty array.

 5. When the `bookmarks` key in the `localStorage` does not contain a valid array of bookmark objects, the `getBookmarks` function should return an empty array.

 6. You should have a function named `displayOrCloseForm`.

 7. Your `displayOrCloseForm` function should toggle the `hidden` class on `#main-section` and `#form-section`.

 8. When you click `#add-bookmark-button`, you should update the inner text of `.category-name` to be the value of the selected option from `#category-dropdown`.

 9. When you click `#add-bookmark-button`, you should call `displayOrCloseForm` to display the form section and hide the main section.

 10. When you click `#close-form-button`, you should call `displayOrCloseForm` to hide the form section and display the main section.

 11. When you click `#add-bookmark-button-form`, you should update the `bookmarks` key stored in the local storage by adding an object to the end of the array. The added object should have `name` set to the value of the `#name` input, `category` set to the value of the selected option from the category dropdown, and `url` set to the value of the `#url` input.

 12. When you click `#add-bookmark-button-form`, you should reset the value of `#name` and `#url` to an empty string.

 13. When you click `#add-bookmark-button-form`, you should run `displayOrCloseForm` to hide the form section and show the main section.

 14. You should have a function named `displayOrHideCategory`.

 15. Your `displayOrHideCategory` function should toggle the `hidden` class on `#main-section` and `#bookmark-list-section`.

 16. When you click `#view-category-button`, you should update the inner text of `.category-name` to be the value of the selected option from `#category-dropdown`.

 17. When you click `#view-category-button`, you should add a `p` element with the text `No Bookmarks Found` to `#category-list`'s inner HTML if none of the bookmarks in local storage have the selected category.

 18. When you click the `#view-category-button`, you should modify the `#category-list` element's inner HTML by adding a radio button. The radio button should have the `id` and `value` attributes set to the bookmark name for each bookmark in the selected category. Additionally, each radio button should have the same `name` attribute.

 19. Each radio button added to `#category-list`'s inner HTML should have a corresponding label containing an anchor element with the bookmark name and the `href` attribute set to the bookmark URL.

 20. Each `label` element should contain an anchor element with the bookmark name as text, and the `href` attribute set to the bookmark URL.

 21. When you click `#close-list-button`, you should hide `#bookmark-list-section` and display the main section.

 22. When you click the `#close-list-button` and then open any category, the `#category-list` should contain only data relevant for the selected category, without duplicating entries.

 23. When you click the `#delete-bookmark-button`, you should delete the bookmark corresponding to the selected radio button and appropriate category from the local storage and update the displayed bookmark list.
