# Build a Sorting Visualizer

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

The Bubble Sort algorithm sorts a sequence of integers by comparing couples of adjacent elements starting from the beginning of the sequence. If the first element is greater than the second one, it swaps them. Then, it proceeds with the following couple. When the last element of the sequence is reached, it starts a new cycle from the beginning of the sequence, and repeats the process until the elements are sorted. The algorithm stops after one cycle completes with no swaps.

For this lab, you have been provided with all the HTML and CSS. You will use JavaScript to complete the Bubble Sort Visualizer so that it visualizes each step needed by the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of five integers.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have a function named `generateElement` that returns a random integer between `1` and `100`, inclusive.
2. You should have a function named `generateArray` that uses the `generateElement` function to return an array containing five random integers.
3. You should have a function named `generateContainer` that creates and returns an empty `div` element.
4. You should have a function named `fillArrContainer` that takes an HTML element as the first argument and an array as the second argument.
5. The `fillArrContainer` should take an element as its first parameter and an array of integers as its second parameter, then populate the element with five `span` elements, with each `span` showing one of the integers from the array.
6. You should have a function named `isOrdered` that takes two integers and returns a boolean indicating if the first integer is less than or equal to the second.
7. You should have a function named `swapElements` that takes an array of integers and a numeric index.
8. The `swapElements` function should modify the array in place by swapping the element at the passed index and the following element if `isOrdered` returns `false`.
9. You should have a function named `highlightCurrentEls` that takes an HTML element and a numeric index.
10. The `highlightCurrentEls` function should set the `border` of the given element's child at the given index, and the child immediately after the index, to have a `dashed` style, a `red` color, and a width of your choice.
11. When you click `#generate-btn` you should use the `fillArrContainer` function to fill `#starting-array` with five `span` elements, each with a random number as its text. If present, other elements should be removed from `#array-container`.
12. You should implement the Bubble Sort algorithm so that after you click `#sort-btn`, `#array-container` contains a `div` element for each of the steps required by the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the starting array, including the `div` representing the starting array and a `div` representing the sorted array. The functions you have created so far can be useful here.
13. Each `div` should contain five `span` elements, representing the array in its current state of being sorted.
14. After you click `#sort-btn`, `#starting-array` should represent the starting step with the initial array and the first two integers highlighted.
15. For each sorting step, you should use `highlightCurrentEls` to highlight the two numbers that are being compared, and swap them in the next step by using `swapElements`.

## Tests

1. You should have a function named `generateElement`.

2. Your `generateElement` function should return a random integer between `1` and `100` inclusive.

3. You should have a function named `generateArray`.

4. Your `generateArray` function should make use of the `generateElement` function.

5. Your `generateArray` function should return an array containing five random integers between `1` and `100`.

6. You should have a function named `generateContainer`.

7. Your `generateContainer` function should return an empty `div` element.

8. You should have a function named `fillArrContainer`.

9. Your `fillArrContainer()` should take an element as its first parameter and an array of integers as its second parameter, then populate the element with five `span` elements, with each `span` showing one of the integers from the array.

10. You should have a function named `isOrdered`.

11. Your `isOrdered` function should take two integers and should return a boolean indicating if the first integer is less than or equal to the second.

12. You should have a function named `swapElements`.

13. Your `swapElements` function take an array of integers and a numeric index as arguments. It should modify the array passed in place by swapping the element at the given index and the following element if the first element is greater than the second.

14. You should have a function named `highlightCurrentEls`.

15. Your `highlightCurrentEls` function should give the descendants of the specified element, located at the given index and the next index, a border that is `dashed`, `red`, and set to a width of your choice.

16. When you click `#generate-btn` you should fill `#starting-array` with five `span` elements, each with a random number between `1` and `100` as its text.

17. When `#starting-array` already contains a generated array, or `#array-container` contains the sorted array, clicking the `#generate-btn` should remove other elements in the `#array-container`, leaving only `#starting-array` with newly generated numbers.

18. After you click `#sort-btn`, `#array-container` should contain as many `div` elements as the steps required by the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the starting array, including the `div` representing the starting array and a `div` representing the sorted array.

19. After you click `#sort-btn`, each `div` within `#array-container` should contain five `span`, each with a number as its text, and arranged to represent the steps required by Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the starting array.

20. When you click the `#sort-btn`, you should make use of the `highlightCurrentEls` function to highlight the elements being compared in each step.

21. After you click `#sort-btn`, `#starting-array` should represent the starting step with the initial array and the first two integers highlighted using `highlightCurrentEls`.
