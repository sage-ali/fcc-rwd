# Build a Lightbox Viewer

Build an app that is functionally similar to this [example project](assets/task-1.png). Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

A lightbox is used on websites to showcase multimedia content in a more engaging way through use of a popup or modal window over the page's main content.

In this lab, you will create a lightbox gallery that displays full-size images when a thumbnail is clicked. For each image, two versions are provided: a thumbnail and a full-size image. The full-size image is the same as the thumbnail, but without the `-thumbnail` suffix.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should have a `div` with a class of `gallery` within your `body`.

2. Within the `.gallery` element, you should have three image thumbnails, each with a class of `gallery-item`. You should use the following links for thumbnail images:

    * `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/stonehenge-thumbnail.jpg`
    * `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/storm-thumbnail.jpg`
    * `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/trees-thumbnail.jpg`
3. You should have a `div` with a class of `lightbox` within your `body`.

4. You should have a `button` with an `id` of `close-btn` within your `.lightbox` element. You can use `&times;` as its text if you want.

5. You should have a `img` with an `id` of `lightbox-image` within your `.lightbox` element.

6. Your `.lightbox` element should have a fixed position so that the preview opens on top of the current images.

7. Your `.lightbox` element should cover the entire viewport by setting the height and width to 100% of the container. You should ensure that the `.lightbox` element starts at the top left corner of the container.

8. `.lightbox` should have a background color. Initially, its `display` property should be set to `none` to hide it.

9. When you click one of your `.gallery-item` elements, the `.lightbox` element's `display` property should be set to `flex` to make the `.lightbox` element and the two elements within it visible.

10. When you click one of your `.gallery-item` elements, the `#lightbox-image` element's `src` should be set to a full-size version of the image clicked by removing `-thumbnail` from the image's `src` attribute. The full-size images are located at the following links:

    * `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/stonehenge.jpg`
    * `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/storm.jpg`
    * `https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/labs/trees.jpg`

11. When your `.lightbox` element is visible and you click the `#close-btn` or the `.lightbox` element, the `.lightbox` element's `display` should be set back to `none`.

**Note:** Be sure to link your stylesheet and the JavaScript file in your HTML.
