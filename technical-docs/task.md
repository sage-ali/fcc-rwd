Build a Technical Documentation Page
====================================

Build an app that is functionally similar to this example project. Try not to copy the example project, give it your own personal style.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
2. Within the `#main-doc` element, you can see several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of five.
3. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
4. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="JavaScript_and_Java"`).
5. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each).
6. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `code` elements total (not each).
7. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `li` items total (not each).
8. You can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`.
9. The navbar element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
10. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`.
11. The `header` element in the `#navbar` must come before any link (`a`) elements in the navbar.
12. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
13. When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `#main-doc` element (e.g. If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id, and contains the corresponding header).
14. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
15. Your technical documentation should use at least one media query.

**Note:** Be sure to link your stylesheet in your HTML and apply your CSS.

Tests
-----

1. You should have a `main` element with an `id` of `main-doc`.
2. You should have at least five `section` elements with a class of `main-section`.
3. All of your `.main-section` elements should be `section` elements.
4. You should have at least five `.main-section` elements that are descendants of `#main-doc`.
5. The first child of each `.main-section` should be a `header` element.
6. None of your `header` elements should be empty.
7. All of your `.main-section` elements should have an `id`.
8. Each `.main-section` should have an `id` that matches the text of its first child, having any spaces in the child's text replaced with underscores (`_`) for the id's.
9. You should have at least 10 `p` elements (total) within your `.main-section` elements.
10. You should have at least five `code` elements that are descendants of `.main-section` elements.
11. You should have at least five `li` elements that are descendants of `.main-section` elements.
12. You should have a `nav` element with an `id` of `navbar`.
13. Your `#navbar` should have exactly one `header` element within it.
14. You should have at least one `a` element with a class of `nav-link`.
15. All of your `.nav-link` elements should be anchor (`a`) elements.
16. All of your `.nav-link` elements should be in the `#navbar`.
17. You should have the same number of `.nav-link` and `.main-section` elements.
18. The `header` element in the `#navbar` should come before any link (`a`) elements also in the `#navbar`.
19. Each `.nav-link` should have text that corresponds to the `header` text of its related `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your `#navbar` should have a `.nav-link` which has the text "Hello world").
20. Each `.nav-link` should have an `href` attribute that links to its corresponding `.main-section` (e.g. If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id).
21. Your `#navbar` should always be on the left edge of the window.
22. Your Technical Documentation project should use at least one media query.
