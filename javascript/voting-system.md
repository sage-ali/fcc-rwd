# Build a Voting System

In this lab, you will build a voting system that uses `Map` to create a poll and `Set` to prevent duplicate voting.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

**User Stories:**

1. You should initialize a `poll` variable to a new `Map` object.

2. You should have a function `addOption` that accepts a parameter `option`.

3. In the `addOption` function:

    * If the `option` does not already exist in the poll, it should be added to the poll with an empty `Set` as its value to track voters. You should also return the message `Option "<option>" added to the poll.`

    * If the `option` already exists, it should return the message `Option "<option>" already exists.`.

    * If you try to add an empty option, the function should return the message `Option cannot be empty.`.

4. You should have a function `vote` that accepts two parameters, `option` (the option to vote for) and `voterId` (a unique ID for the voter).

5. In the `vote` function:

    * If the `option` does not exist in the poll, the function should return the message `Option "<option>" does not exist.`.

    * If the `option` exists, the function should check if the `voterId` has already voted for this `option`.

    * If the voter has already voted, the function should return the message `Voter <voterId> has already voted for "<option>".`

    * If the voter has not voted, `voterId` should be added to the `Set` of `voters` for this option. The function should return the message `Voter <voterId> voted for "<option>".`

6. You should have at least three options in your `poll`.

7. Your `poll` should have at least three votes.

8. You should have a function `displayResults` that returns the poll results in the following format:

```js
Poll Results:
OptionA: N votes
OptionB: N votes
.
.

/*
sample output

Poll Results:
Turkey: 2 votes
Morocco: 1 votes
*/
```

## Tests

1. You should have a `poll` variable initialized to a new `Map` object.
2. You should define a function `addOption` that accepts a parameter `option`.
3. You should define a function `vote` that accepts two parameters, `option` and `voterId`.
4. You should define a function `displayResults` to display the poll results.
5. You should have at least three options in your `poll`.
6. Your `poll` should have at least three votes.
7. You should ensure each voting option maps to a `Set` object.
8. `addOption("Egypt")` should return `Option "Egypt" added to the poll.`
9. Adding an empty option should return `"Option cannot be empty."`
10. When `Turkey` is already added, `addOption("Turkey")` should return `Option "Turkey" already exists.`
11. When `Malaysia` exists in the voting options, `vote("Malaysia", "traveler1")` should return `Voter traveler1 voted for "Malaysia".`
12. `vote` should update the `Set` of voters for an option.
13. When `traveler1` tries to vote for `Algeria` again, `vote("Algeria", "traveler1")` should return `Voter traveler1 has already voted for "Algeria".`
14. Duplicate votes should not increase the size of the `Set`.
15. When `Nigeria` is not in the voting options, `vote("Nigeria", "traveler2")` should return `Option "Nigeria" does not exist.`
16. A unique option should be able to receive multiple votes.
17. `displayResults()` should return the results in the correct format.
